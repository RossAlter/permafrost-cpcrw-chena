## Created
April 2025

## Purpose
This repository contains the data needed to reproduce the figures in the Alter et al. manuscript "Using an observation-based map of permafrost extent to inform permafrost predictions in a large Alaskan watershed", which has been submitted to JGR Earth Surface.

## Data
This repository contains one directory of files associated with the figures in the Alter et al. manuscript:

* "Figure_data"

  * The figure data are the raw data that are used to produce each figure in the Alter et al. manuscript.

  * *Notes*:

    * For Figure 4, please use the following legend to translate the numerical data:

      * 0 = n/a
      * 1 = false negative
      * 2 = false positive
      * 3 = true negative
      * 4 = true positive

    * For Figure 8, please use the following legend to translate the numerical data:

      * 0 = no permafrost
      * 0.5 = inconclusive (masked)
      * 1 = yes permafrost
